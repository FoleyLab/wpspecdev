I think after the analysis during these weeks the analysis of the DRS spectra is clear. I am putting things together to write the article, and I have some ideas want to test for photocatalysis using these spheres, if the results are good I will include them together.
I may need your help again to get some extinction spectra. 

1. I think the extinction spectra from 200 - 1100 nm will be more helpful (if 200 is not possible then 300 is also good). The samples I currently have are 112, 173, 262, 353, 441, 561, 680, 864, 1089 nm in diameter. And I would also like to include spheres with 1300 and 1500 nm in diameter for prediction only.

SiO2 RI starts at 210 nm, should be ok to extrapolate to 200 nm:
2.1e-07 1.53836 0.00000



2. I also include the DRS of Pt NPs solution here. It is dispersed in water, and it will be helpful if you could convert it to data in air by changing the refractive index from 1.33 to 1. The bg in the data means everything without Pt, it is negligible.
Thanks for your help again!\

Notes: 

- Radius of Pt nanoparticles is 4 nm
- Pt RI starts at 247 nm:  2.4797e-07 1.4979e+00 1.6810e+00
  Need to add ability for water RI to Mie code
