    "# Computing CIE Coordinates from Spectra\n",
    "(short video demo [here](https://youtu.be/ZRFJSZF6mr0))\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate the use of the WPTherml package to compute the CIE coordinates from a \n",
    "spectrum.  The general idea is described concisely in [this page](http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_Spect_to_XYZ.html).  Given an emission spectrum $I_e(\\lambda)$ the raw CIE coordinates ($X, Y,$ and $Z$) can be computed as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "X = \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2}  I_e(\\lambda) \\bar{x}(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\\\\n",

    "Z = \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} I_e(\\lambda) \\bar{z}(\\lambda) d\\lambda\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\bar{x}(\\lambda), \\bar{y}(\\lambda), \\bar{z}(\\lambda)$ are the CIE observer functions that encode the response of the color cones of the human eye.  We data from discrete samples of these observer functions\n",
    "stored in [this file](https://github.com/FoleyLab/wptherml/blob/main/wptherml/data/cie_cmf.txt).  *Note: We need\n",
    "to identify the source of this data!*\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in noramalized CIE values, so we define a normalization constant from the raw CIE values,\n",
    "$$ N = X + Y + Z, $$\n",
    "and report normalized coordinates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x = \\frac{X}{N} \\\\\n",
    "y = \\frac{Y}{N} \\\\\n",
    "z = \\frac{Z}{N}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "With discretized samples of the emission spectra and the CIE observer functions, we can compute \n",
    "CIE coordinates through numerical integration, for example using the trapezoid rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "WPTherml has a built-in method called `compute_cie(spectrum)` for performing the integrals shown above with the correct discretized\n",
    "samples of CIE observer functions and the spectrum stored in an array called `spectrum`.  After \n",
    "reading in an emission spectrum of interest from a data file, we can deploy this `compute_cie()` method\n",
    "to compute the CIE coordinates of this spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validating the CIE Coordinate Computation\n",
    "The concept of a [Planckian Locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planckian_locus) is helpful for validating the `compute_cie()` method.  The Planckian Locus forms a path of colors (and corresponding CIE coordinates) that an ideal Blackbody emitter would have as a function of temperature.  There is also a simple approximation for the Planckian Locus as a function of temperature (see the cubic equation under the **Approximation** heading in the Wikipeadia Page linked above).  The following blocks of code will import the WPTherml package, create an instance of an incandescent emitter (in this case, a simple Tungsten slab), then compute the thermal emission spectrum of this slab, along with the thermal emission of an ideal blackbody, at a range of temperatures and compare the path of CIE $x$ and $y$ coordinates with those that lie along the Planckian locus.  The CIE coordinates of the Tungsten emitter should be close, though not necessarily on the Planckian locus, while the Blackbody values should exactly match (to within numerical roundoff error) the Planckian locus if our `compute_cie()` method is working properly."
